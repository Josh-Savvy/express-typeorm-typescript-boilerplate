# Express-TypeORM-Typescript Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for quickly starting with an Express.js server using TypeORM with TypeScript.

## Features

-   **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
-   **TypeORM**: ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5). Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and more.
-   **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
-   **nodemon**: Utility that monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   Node.js installed (v12 or higher)
-   npm or yarn package manager
-   Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) installed and running
